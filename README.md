# US Multinational AI Labs

The data in [Multinational-AI-Labs.csv](Multinational-AI-Labs.csv) supports CSET’s paper “Mapping U.S. Multinationals’ Global AI R&D Activity.” The data include all AI R&D labs that we were able to locate using public sources for four companies: Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. The two other companies we analyzed in the paper either do not use “labs” to structure their AI R&D (Amazon) or do not publicly disclose their R&D locations (Apple).  

The dataset contains following variables:  

* **Lab Title** and **Company**: Name of the company and lab conducting AI R&D.   
* **City** and **Country**: The geographic location of the AI R&D lab. 
* **Basic Research**, **Applied Research**, and **Experimental Development**: Binary indicator for whether a lab performs a particular type of R&D (1 = yes). For the definitions we used for these categories of R&D, see Appendix D of the paper.   
* **Sources**: Hyperlinks to company websites and news reports that we used to confirm the lab’s existence and to infer what type of R&D is performed by the lab. Where possible, the coding choices were complemented and confirmed in conversations with company representatives.

Further context on the definitions, inclusion criteria, and methodology we used to map AI R&D labs can be found in Appendix A of the paper.
